## Project Description
Building the dashboard for Coffee Shop Sales by creating valuable insights which provide a clear report for stakeholders to easily understand Coffee's recent sales performance and to answer key questions about the Coffee Sales and demand.

## Primary Goals
## The main goal is to provide valuable insights representing:

1) Total sales, total orders, and total quantities sold in the current month, representing profit or loss% compared with the previous month.
   
2) A calendar table for each month to select the particular month and date.

3) A weekday table for each day, selecting a particular hour in each day and representing sales visually on each day and hour.

4) Analyzing the sales trend during each day of the month and each hour. 

## Dashboard Overview:
1) Provides information on total sales, total quantities sold, and total orders.

2) The donut chart provides information about the total number of sales during weekends and weekdays.

3) The calendar table represents the dates in each month, which visually represents the total sales, total orders, and quantities sold for each date when we hover over a particular date.

4) The clustered bar chart of store location, product category, and top 10 products of total number of sales represents the data labels with percentage and total number of sales compared with the previous month.

5) The clustered column chart provides information about the total sales for each day in a selected month and the sales for each day in a week.

6) The week and hour table represents the total sales for each hour on a particular weekday.

7) The stacked bar chart visually represents the total sales for each hour of all days in a week.

8) A filter panel is used to select the desired month.

9) Finally, customize the visualized report by changing the font, colors, background, and applying many effects to make the dashboard interesting.

## Steps for dashboard creation:
- 1 Data Connection: Extract the data into MySQL for data cleaning.
- 2 Data Transformation: Clean the unnecessary data and transform it as per the requirement.
- 3 Data modeling: Establish the relationships between the data to avoid inappropriate results.
- 4 Load Data: Load the transformed data into hashtag#powerbi and create calculated measures and columns using strong DAX as per requirement.
- 5 Data Visualization: Using various visualization tools, create graphs such as pie charts, bars, histogram charts, etc. to visualize the data and create reports within Report View.
- 6 Formatting: After completion of creating the report, format the view through various themes and layouts.
- 7 Add filters and slicers for interactive reports.
- 8 Finally, publish the report.
